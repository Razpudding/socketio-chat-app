# Tragedy of the commons chat app

A chat app built using the socket.io library that fades out words as they beome more common within the app, forcing users to use original language and to expand their vocabulary. If they don't, their words become void of color, like the meaningless day-to-day chatter is void of meaning.

This repo serves as the basis for an educational tool designed to teach students about realtime web application development.

We aim to give students a means of developing a web application capable of communicating with a remote server without using any frameworks. The idea is to find a good balance between as much core/vanilla js code and ease of development.

Feature wishlist:
* Better UI (with autofous, styling, more user feedback)
* List of users online
* list of 10 most used words
* way of highlighting a word that's about to fade out forever
* a gamification element that either rewards or punishes users based on their originality
* Difficulty settings (hardcore is limit a word to 3 uses for instance)
* A list of exceptions for Dutch and English for words that are critical and irreplacable (like 'it')
